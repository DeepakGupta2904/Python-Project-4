# Python-Project-4
Project: - Titanic Survival Prediction.
I am done this project at CodSoft as an Intern.

In this project, I am utilizing the Titanic dataset to construct a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic beginner project involves readily available data, including information about individual passengers such as age, gender, ticket details, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
